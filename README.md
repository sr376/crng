Graphical Password Authentication is a GitHub project that provides an additional layer of security to alphanumeric passwords by using images as passwords. With this project, users can create a unique and personalized image password by selecting images from a pre-defined set. This password can then be used in combination with a traditional alphanumeric password for enhanced security. This project is ideal for applications where password protection is critical, such as online banking, e-commerce, or social media. By providing an additional layer of authentication, this project can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information. This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to build a server and a client for the application.
